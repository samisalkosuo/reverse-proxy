= Reverse proxy

Simple reverse proxy as a container.

Use case:

* an existing service using self-signed certificate.
* another existing service needs to connect to the service but self-signed cert is not accepted.
* need to introduce access point with valid certificate.

Solution:

* run container in some service that offers valid certificates for endpoints.
** like IBM Code Engine.
* use host name provided by the service (like IBM Code Engine) to access the existing service.

** BACKEND_PROTOCOL - _http_ or _https_
** BACKEND_HOST - host (and port) of the backend server
