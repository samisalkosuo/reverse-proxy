= Reverse proxy

Simple reverse proxy as a container.

Use case:

* an existing service using self-signed certificate.
* another existing service needs to connect to the service but self-signed cert is not accepted.
* need to introduce access point with valid certificate.

Solution:

* run container in some service that offers valid certificates for endpoints.
** like https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine[IBM Cloud Code Engine].
* use host name provided by the service (like https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine[IBM Cloud Code Engine]) to access the existing service.

== Usage

* Run reverse proxy:
```
docker run -d -p 81:8080 -e BACKEND_PROTOCOL=https -e BACKEND_HOST=backend.server.com kazhar/reverse-proxy
```
* Mandatory environment variables
** BACKEND_PROTOCOL - _http_ or _https_
** BACKEND_HOST - host (and port) of the backend server
* Default self-signed certificate is `reverseproxy.local.net`
** Set custom hostname and domain using TLS_HOSTNAME and TLS_DOMAIN environment variables. For example:
```
docker run -d -p 81:8080 -e BACKEND_PROTOCOL=https -e BACKEND_HOST=backend.server.com -e TLS_HOSTNAME=frontend -e TLS_DOMAIN=example.com kazhar/reverse-proxy
```
* Other environment variables:
** LOG=true - enable logging.
** LOG_FORMAT - _common_, _combined_ or _combinedio_. Default is _common_.
* Set CA- certificate as trusted in RHEL-based Linux:
** Copy `ca.crt` to `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`
** Execute `update-ca-trust extract`
